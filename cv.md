### Briefly About Myself
Since University graduation I used to work in Hospitality industry. I used to work in 3-5* hotels in different parts of Sochi.
Then I worked for international cruise company Viking Cruises for three years as a Program Director of a river Cruise Ship.
And now I intended to start new carrier in IT industry. Since I find this industry dynamically developing and advanced.

I speak fluent English and advanced Chinese.  Often, I take different topics online courses for self-education.
And now I dedicate my time to study Frontend Development, as I am deeply interested in becoming one of developers quite shortly.
